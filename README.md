My passion lies in solving challenging problems, designing algorithms, and communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders.
I always look to exceed expectations and am effective both working as an individual and as part of a team.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, listening to music, reading books, and traveling.

I enjoy learning new things and connecting with people across a range of industries.
